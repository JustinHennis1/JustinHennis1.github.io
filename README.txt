### About Me
Hi, my name is Justin and as a student I would like to showcase some of
my work. A little bit about me, I am an Egyptian American who majored in computer science.
If you know anything about being Egyptian you know that your parents have expectations, one
is to be a doctor and two is to be a doctor. 
	The decision to go into the tech industry was a practical one from my point 
of view. I didn't see myself working in a hospital 24/7 but 
I also wanted to pick a major that could serve me in various career paths, in this way
Computer Science was an obvious choice for me --After completing my first year of college 
of course. This was not the only reason, I consider myself to be an artist, a somewhat creative
person who enjoys making new things. To me, that is what Computer Science is all about. Yes,
its also about solving problems that can increase revenue but each problem can be answered with
a unique idea.
	If you are interested in learning more about me feel free to reach out. I appreciate you
for taking the time to read this, have a blessed day.
